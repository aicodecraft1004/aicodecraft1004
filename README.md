# Hi, I'm Walter Joy 👋  

Senior Applied AI & Full‑Stack Engineer • Building reliable, production‑grade AI systems

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and ship **AI‑native products**: copilots, agents, and intelligent workflows that people actually use in real systems.  
- Build **LLM systems end‑to‑end**: retrieval (RAG), tools, memory, and evaluation wired into production backends and frontends.  
- Focus on **reliability and observability**: tracing, guardrails, tests, and clear failure modes instead of fragile demos.

I care about AI that *does something useful*—drives decisions, automates work, and fits cleanly into existing products and infrastructure.

## 🧩 Selected Projects

- **[Project Name #1]** – Brief description of an AI copilot/agent you built (e.g., “LLM‑powered internal copilot with RAG, tools, and evaluation harness for [domain].”).  
- **[Project Name #2]** – Full‑stack AI app (e.g., “Next.js + Python backend, vector search, auth, and usage analytics for an AI‑driven product.”).  
- **[Project Name #3]** – Infra or reliability tooling (e.g., “Evaluation and tracing layer for LLM workflows with regression tests and dashboards.”).

## 🧱 How I Work

- Start from the **real workflow and constraints**, then choose the right models and architecture.  
- Design **simple, composable systems** that are easy to reason about and extend.  
- Ship iteratively with **tests, observability, and clear interfaces** so teams can trust and build on the system.

If you need AI features that are **robust enough for production** and aligned with real product goals, that’s where I’m most effective.
